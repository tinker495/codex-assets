name: desloppify
description: >
  Codebase health scanner and technical debt tracker. Use when the user asks
  about code quality, technical debt, dead code, large files, god classes,
  duplicate functions, code smells, naming issues, import cycles, or coupling
  problems. Also use when asked for a health score, what to fix next, or to
  create a cleanup plan. Supports TypeScript/React, Python, and C#/.NET.

# Desloppify

## 1. Your Job

**Improve code quality by fixing findings and maximizing strict score honestly.**
Never hide debt with suppression patterns just to improve lenient score. After
every scan, show the user ALL scores:

| What | How |
|------|-----|
| Overall health | lenient + strict |
| 5 mechanical dimensions | File health, Code quality, Duplication, Test health, Security |
| 7 subjective dimensions | Naming Quality, Error Consistency, Abstraction Fit, Logic Clarity, AI Generated Debt, Type Safety, Contract Coherence |

Never skip scores. The user tracks progress through them.

## 2. Core Loop

```
scan → follow the tool's strategy → fix or wontfix → rescan
```

1. `desloppify scan --path .` — the scan output ends with **INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENTS**. Follow them. Don't substitute your own analysis.
2. Fix the issue the tool recommends.
3. `desloppify resolve fixed "<id>"` — or if it's intentional/acceptable:
   `desloppify resolve wontfix "<id>" --note "reason why"`
4. Rescan to verify.

**Wontfix is not free.** It lowers the strict score. The gap between lenient and strict IS wontfix debt. Call it out when:
- Wontfix count is growing — challenge whether past decisions still hold
- A dimension is stuck 3+ scans — suggest a different approach
- Auto-fixers exist for open findings — ask why they haven't been run

## 3. Commands

```bash
desloppify scan --path src/               # full scan
desloppify scan --path src/ --reset-subjective  # reset subjective baseline to 0, then scan
desloppify next --count 5                  # top priorities
desloppify show <pattern>                  # filter by file/detector/ID
desloppify plan                            # prioritized plan
desloppify fix <fixer> --dry-run           # auto-fix (dry-run first!)
desloppify move <src> <dst> --dry-run      # move + update imports
desloppify resolve fixed|wontfix|false_positive "<pat>"   # classify finding outcome
desloppify review --prepare                # generate subjective review data
desloppify review --import file.json       # import review results
```

## 4. Subjective Reviews (biggest score lever)

Score = 40% mechanical + 60% subjective. Subjective starts at 0% until reviewed.

1. `desloppify review --prepare` — writes dimension definitions and codebase context
   to `query.json`.

2. **Launch parallel subagents** — one message, multiple Task calls. Split the
   dimensions across agents however makes sense. Give each agent:
   - The codebase path and the dimensions to score
   - What each dimension means (from `query.json`'s `dimension_prompts`)
   - The output format (below)
   - Nothing else — let them decide what to read and how

3. Merge `assessments` (average multi-agent scores) and `findings`, then import:
   ```bash
   desloppify review --import findings.json
   ```

   Required output format per agent:
   ```json
   {
     "assessments": { "naming_quality": 75.0, "logic_clarity": 82.0 },
     "findings": [{
       "dimension": "naming_quality",
       "identifier": "short_id",
       "summary": "one line",
       "related_files": ["path/to/file.py"],
       "evidence": ["specific observation"],
       "suggestion": "concrete action"
     }]
   }
   ```

Need a clean subjective rerun from zero? Run `desloppify scan --path src/ --reset-subjective` before preparing/importing fresh review data.

Even moderate scores (60-80) dramatically improve overall health.

Integrity safeguard:
- If one subjective dimension lands exactly on the strict target, the scanner warns and asks for re-review.
- If two or more subjective dimensions land on the strict target in the same scan, those dimensions are auto-reset to 0 for that scan and must be re-reviewed/imported.
- Reviewers should score from evidence only (not from target-seeking).

## 5. Quick Reference

- **Tiers**: T1 auto-fix, T2 quick manual, T3 judgment call, T4 major refactor
- **Zones**: production/script (scored), test/config/generated/vendor (not scored). Fix with `zone set`.
- **Auto-fixers** (TS only): `unused-imports`, `unused-vars`, `debug-logs`, `dead-exports`, etc.
- **query.json**: After any command, has `narrative.actions` with prioritized next steps.
- `--skip-slow` skips duplicate detection for faster iteration.
- `--lang python`, `--lang typescript`, or `--lang csharp` to force language.
- C# defaults to `--profile objective`; use `--profile full` to include subjective review.
- Score can temporarily drop after fixes (cascade effects are normal).

## 6. Escalate Tool Issues Upstream

When desloppify itself appears wrong or inconsistent:

1. Capture a minimal repro (`command`, `path`, `expected`, `actual`).
2. Open a GitHub issue in `peteromallet/desloppify`.
3. If you can fix it safely, open a PR linked to that issue.
4. If unsure whether it is tool bug vs user workflow, issue first, PR second.

## Prerequisite

`command -v desloppify >/dev/null 2>&1 && echo "desloppify: installed" || echo "NOT INSTALLED — run: pip install --upgrade git+https://github.com/peteromallet/desloppify.git"`


## Codex Overlay

This is the canonical Codex overlay used by the README install command.

1. Prefer first-class batch runs: `desloppify review --run-batches --runner codex --parallel`.
2. The command writes immutable packet snapshots under `.desloppify/review_packets/holistic_packet_*.json`; use those for reproducible retries.
3. Keep reviewer input scoped to the immutable packet and the source files named in each batch.
4. Do not use prior chat context, score history, narrative summaries, issue labels, or target-threshold anchoring while scoring.
5. Assess every dimension listed in `query.dimensions`; never drop a requested dimension. If evidence is weak/mixed, score lower and explain uncertainty in findings.
6. Return machine-readable JSON only for review imports:

```json
{
  "assessments": {
    "<dimension_from_query>": 0
  },
  "findings": []
}
```

7. Keep `findings` schema compatible with `query.system_prompt`.
8. If a batch fails, retry only that slice with `desloppify review --run-batches --packet <packet.json> --only-batches <idxs>`.
