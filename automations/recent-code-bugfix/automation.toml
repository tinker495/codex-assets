prompt = "# Recent Code Bugfix\n\n## Overview\n\nFind a bug introduced by the current author in the last week, implement a fix, and verify it when possible. Operate in the current working directory, assume the code is local, and ensure the root cause is tied directly to the author’s own edits.\n\n## Workflow\n\n### 1) Establish the recent-change scope\n\nUse Git to identify the author and changed files from the last week.\n\n- Determine the author from `git config user.name`/`user.email`. If unavailable, use the current user’s name from the environment or ask once.\n- Use `git log --since=1.week --author=<author>` to list recent commits and files. Focus on files touched by those commits.\n- If the user’s prompt is empty, proceed directly with this default scope.\n\n### 2) Find a concrete failure tied to recent changes\n\nPrioritize defects that are directly attributable to the author’s edits.\n\n- Look for recent failures (tests, lint, runtime errors) if logs or CI outputs are available locally.\n- If no failures are provided, run the smallest relevant verification (single test, file-level lint, or targeted repro) that touches the edited files.\n- Confirm the root cause is directly connected to the author’s changes, not unrelated legacy issues. If only unrelated failures are found, stop and report that no qualifying bug was detected.\n\n### 3) Implement the fix\n\nMake a minimal fix that aligns with project conventions.\n\n- Update only the files needed to resolve the issue.\n- Avoid adding extra defensive checks or unrelated refactors.\n- Keep changes consistent with local style and tests.\n\n### 4) Verify\n\nAttempt verification when possible.\n\n- Prefer the smallest validation step (targeted test, focused lint, or direct repro command).\n- If verification cannot be run, state what would be run and why it wasn’t executed.\n\n### 5) Report\n\nSummarize the root cause, the fix, and the verification performed. Make it explicit how the root cause ties to the author’s recent changes."
