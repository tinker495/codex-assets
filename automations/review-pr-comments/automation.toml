prompt = "In the current repo, find all open PRs authored by me. Use the workflow from [$gh-address-comments](/Users/mrx-ksjung/.codex/skills/gh-address-comments/SKILL.md) for each PR: fetch all review threads and comments, summarize and number them, and highlight required actions or risks. Preflight: ensure gh is available with command -v gh; if missing, report and stop. Auth handling override: do not request escalated permissions for gh commands. For all gh commands, set GH_FORCE_TTY=0 GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 GH_PAGER=cat. First run gh auth status; if it fails, verify with gh auth token and gh api user --jq '.login'. If you see /dev/tty errors, retry once with the same env and then report failure. Only if all auth checks fail, ask the user to run gh auth login and stop. Do not apply fixes automatically; ask which numbered comments to address. Report in Korean and open an inbox item with the summary and the question. If there are no open PRs, report that and stop."
