prompt = "In the current repo, find all open PRs authored by me. Use the workflow from [$gh-address-comments](/Users/mrx-ksjung/.codex/skills/gh-address-comments/SKILL.md) for each PR: fetch all review threads and comments, summarize and number them, and highlight required actions or risks. Auth handling override: do not request escalated permissions for gh commands. First run `gh auth status` normally; if it fails, verify with `gh auth token` and `gh api user --jq '.login'`. Only if all auth checks fail, ask the user to run `gh auth login` and stop. Do not apply fixes automatically; ask which numbered comments to address. Report in Korean and open an inbox item with the summary and the question. If there are no open PRs, report that and stop."
