prompt = "In the current repo, find all open PRs authored by me. Use the workflow from [$gh-address-comments](/Users/mrx-ksjung/.codex/skills/gh-address-comments/SKILL.md) for each PR: fetch all review threads and comments, summarize and number them, and highlight required actions or risks. Preflight: ensure gh is available with command -v gh; if missing, report and stop. Auth handling override: do not request escalated permissions for gh commands. For all gh commands, set GH_FORCE_TTY=0 GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0 GH_PAGER=cat. Run checks in this order: gh auth token, gh auth status, gh api user --jq '.login'. If you see /dev/tty errors, retry once with the same env and then report failure. Decision rules: if gh auth token fails with no oauth token and auth status indicates invalid/not logged in, ask the user to run gh auth login and stop. If gh auth token succeeds but gh api user fails with connection/network errors, report network/sandbox limitation and stop without asking for gh auth login. Do not ask for gh auth login on pure connectivity errors. Do not apply fixes automatically; ask which numbered comments to address. Report in Korean and open an inbox item with the summary and the question. If there are no open PRs, report that and stop."
