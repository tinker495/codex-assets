Summary: Diagnosed repeated gh auth prompts as automation runtime constraints (workspace-write sandbox + network-restricted runs can cause gh auth checks to misclassify as login failure). Confirmed normal interactive gh auth works, then hardened automation. Applied two fixes: (1) switched gh credential storage to file (gh auth login --with-token --insecure-storage) so automation can read token without keychain dependency, and (2) updated review-pr-comments automation prompt to distinguish true auth-missing (no oauth token + invalid status) from network/sandbox errors and avoid asking gh auth login on connectivity-only failures.
