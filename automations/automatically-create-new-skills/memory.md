Summary: Reviewed last 24h session noise and applied minimal guardrail refinements to recently touched skills. Updated gh-address-comments with script path existence check, absolute fallback to bundled fetch_comments.py, and /dev/tty-safe gh retry env. Updated ralph-driven-development with required prd.json precheck and --json rejection fallback guidance for quality-plan command. Updated skill-topology-adjuster with --json rejection fallback and uv run --with pyyaml quick_validate retry-once guardrail. Validation passed for all changed skills via uv run --with pyyaml quick_validate.py (one retry needed for gh-address-comments due transient uv/ruff install issue, then passed).

Summary: Applied minimal noise-remediation updates directly in source skills. Updated gh-address-comments with command/path preflight (command -v gh, git rev-parse), rg-based fetch_comments.py discovery, gh-only fallback, and /dev/tty retry rule. Updated gh-fix-ci with preflight, --json rejection fallback, workflow path filtering, and /dev/tty retry rule. Updated path-sensitive automation review-pr-comments prompt to enforce test -f/rg path checks plus git context guard before commands. Validation passed via uv run --with pyyaml quick_validate.py for gh-address-comments and gh-fix-ci.

Summary: Scanned last 24h session tool outputs for noise signals. High-noise signals detected across multiple sessions (quick_validate/YAML/PyYAML, unknown flags, missing prd.json, missing tools, git/tty/jq errors). Recently touched skills by mtime: docs-codebase-alignment-audit, skill-topology-adjuster, swarm-planner, ralph-driven-development, gh-fix-ci, pr-workflow, gh-address-comments, skill-creator, skill-installer. Attempted to refine skills but ~/.codex/skills is not writable in this sandbox; reported required edits instead.

Summary: Scanned last-24h sessions and mapped noise signals to concrete failing commands. High-noise sources tied to docs-codebase-alignment-audit (tmp output + here-doc) and code-health (output dir/ruff cache). Skills dir not writable, so wrote suggested patches to /Users/mrx-ksjung/.codex/worktrees/f316/snk2501o-sinokor-placement-optimization/skill-noise-remediation-proposals.md for manual apply; no skill files modified. Validation not run (blocked: no skill edits).

Last run: 2026-02-11 10:46:56 KST
Summary: Applied direct skill edits for high-noise path workflows. Updated /Users/mrx-ksjung/.codex/skills/docs-codebase-alignment-audit/SKILL.md with path-guarded baseline checks, writable-destination fallback, here-doc avoidance, and operational noise controls. Updated /Users/mrx-ksjung/.codex/skills/code-health/SKILL.md with writable out-dir fallback logic, here-doc avoidance, and writable RUFF_CACHE_DIR guard. Validation succeeded on first attempt via uv run --with pyyaml quick_validate.py for both skills.
Last run: 2026-02-11 10:52:34 KST
Summary: HIGH noise confirmed from last-24h session outputs; applied minimal guardrail refinements to 10 existing skills (code-health, docs-codebase-alignment-audit, pr-workflow, gh-address-comments, gh-fix-ci, ralph-driven-development, skill-topology-adjuster, swarm-planner, skill-creator, skill-installer) and 2 path-sensitive automations (review-pr-comments, daily-automation-review). Added search-as-discovery, path filtering, trace-plus-rg evidence gating, git/path preflight checks, --json/--repo/jq/TTY fallback rules, and yaml/quick_validate uv+pyyaml retry policy. Validation: uv run --with pyyaml quick_validate.py passed for all changed skills on first run.
