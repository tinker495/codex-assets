Summary: Detected path-sensitive noise from missing collect_branch_info.py in recent sessions and applied minimal guardrail updates to branch-onboarding-brief, branch-health-remediation-workflow, and code-health. Added explicit test -f/test -d checks, rg-based path verification, and git-context fallback guidance. Validation passed via uv run --with pyyaml quick_validate.py for all three updated skills.
