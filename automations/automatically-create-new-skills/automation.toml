prompt = "Review the last day of ~/.codex/sessions and detect skill-level operational noise across all used skills, including repeated broad searches, fallback loops, repeated retries, and user correction patterns. When a skill shows high noise, automatically refine that personal skill context so first-pass behavior includes search-as-discovery, path filtering, trace-plus-rg evidence gating, and fallback rules. Noise trigger (last 24h sessions): if any of [quick_validate failure, frontmatter/YAML error, PyYAML install/run mention, No such file or directory, missing collect_branch_info.py, missing /shared/code-health] appears, then refine only the recently touched skill(s) and path-sensitive automations. Guardrails: quote any YAML frontmatter value that contains ':', re-run quick_validate.py once, and if it fails twice, stop and report. Guardrails for path-sensitive workflows: before running repo scripts or shared paths, verify existence with test -f/test -d or rg --files; if missing, fallback to git-based branch context commands (git log --since=1.week --name-only, git diff --stat), skip non-existent shared paths, and continue. Execution note: when validation is required, run via uv run --with pyyaml to avoid missing PyYAML. Update existing personal skills first, keep edits minimal, validate with quick_validate.py, and open an inbox item with noise signals, changed skill files, and rationale. Create a new skill only if no existing skill can absorb the repeated pattern."
