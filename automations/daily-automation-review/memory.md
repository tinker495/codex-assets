- Summary: Scanned 2026-02-09 sessions and automation TOMLs. Detected recurring noise: ModuleNotFoundError yaml, command-not-found (grepai-deep-analysis/timeout/pdfinfo), No such file or directory, not-a-git-repo, and gh errors (unknown flag --repo, unable to resolve PR from branch, jq parse error). Prepared ranked recommendations with prompt deltas targeting automatically-create-new-skills (add triggers + guardrails for missing commands/gh flag/jq parse and PR-resolution fallback) and optional review-pr-comments guardrail note.

- Summary: Reviewed 2026-02-09 sessions and automations. Found recurring sandbox denials: here-doc temp file creation failures (5 files), blocked-by-policy rm cleanup attempts (6), and operation-not-permitted writes to /tmp or repo docs. Recommended updating 'Automatically create new skills' automation prompt with new noise triggers and guardrails (avoid here-docs, avoid rm, verify writable paths before writes). No automation files changed.

- Summary: Applied ranked recommendation by updating existing automation 'automatically-create-new-skills'. Added explicit high-noise threshold (>=2 hits or >=2 sessions), new sandbox-denial triggers (here-doc temp failure, Sandbox(Denied, PermissionError, blocked by policy), and guardrails to avoid here-doc/rm cleanup plus writable-path checks with fallback. Updated updated_at; no new automation created.

- Summary: Executed the ranked updates on existing automations only (no new automation). Updated `automatically-create-new-skills` prompt with additional recurring noise triggers (`unknown flag --repo`, `jq parse error`, `unable to resolve PR from current branch`, missing `timeout`/`pdfinfo`) and concrete fallback guardrails. Updated `review-pr-comments` prompt with explicit fallback rules for PR-resolution failure and `--repo` flag rejection. Validated both files with TOML parsing.
